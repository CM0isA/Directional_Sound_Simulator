# Directional Sound Simulator
Made in Unity 2020 the project let the user chose a 3D point in space and emulates a audio source based on the coordinates relative to a center point.

Multiple sound sources can be added and controlled using WASD to adjust position around the listener. Each source will have a display showing the azimuth angle and the elevation relative to the listener.
